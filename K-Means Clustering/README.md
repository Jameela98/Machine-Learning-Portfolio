#  K-Means Clustering: Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
This project was my hands-on exploration of **K-Means Clustering**, one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms. The goal was simple but meaningful: group customers into segments based on their behavior and numerical characteristics. Instead of predicting an outcome, I wanted to uncover natural patterns in the data and see how customers cluster together.

## About the Dataset
The dataset I worked with is a synthetic customer segmentation dataset that includes a mix of useful numerical features such as:

- Spending patterns
- Income levels
- Various feature measurements that describe customer behavior

Even though the dataset is synthetic, it reflects the structure of real-world segmentation problems used in marketing and retail.

## How I Approached the Analysis
Here’s the workflow I followed to build and interpret the clusters:
 Project Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
I began by exploring the dataset through:
- Statistical summaries of numerical features
- Visualizations comparing key metrics between Private and Public universities
- Scatterplots to identify natural groupings in the data

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical variables appropriately
- Ensured data was properly formatted for clustering algorithms

### 3. Model Implementation
- Applied K-Means clustering with 2 clusters, corresponding to the known Private and Public university types
- Trained the model using only the numerical features, excluding the Private/Public labels

### 4. Results Evaluation
- Compared the clustering results against the actual Private/Public labels
- Analyzed cluster characteristics to understand what features drove the segmentation
