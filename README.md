# My Machine Learning Journey: A Portfolio

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio! This collection brings together the most impactful tasks I have done during my recent coursework in applied machine learning.  

I designed this repository to showcase my journey and practical skills—from the first steps of cleaning messy data to the challenge of engineering robust features and building models for everything from classification to deep learning.  

Everything here is built in Python, primarily using Jupyter Notebooks, and leverages the classic data science stack: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and the power of TensorFlow. Each folder contains a dedicated notebook and a project-specific README detailing my approach, the sticky problems I solved, and the key takeaways.

## Projects: Diving Deeper

Here’s a snapshot of the projects, covering a wide range of essential ML techniques:

- **911 Calls: An EDA Deep Dive** – Investigated emergency call data to uncover hidden trends related to time, location, and call type. A great exercise in pattern hunting.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in Practice** – Focused on feature scaling and selecting the optimal value for *k* in this fundamental classification task.  
- **Linear Regression: Beyond the Basics** – Modeled relationships while analyzing residuals and evaluating the real impact of errors.  
- **Logistic Regression: Binary Decisions** – Tuned and examined performance metrics to truly understand binary classification results.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM): The Kernel Challenge** – Experimented with different kernels (linear vs. RBF) and observed how configuration choices affect the decision boundary.  
- **K-Means Clustering: Grouping Unlabeled Data** – Applied clustering to find natural groupings and analyzed what these clusters mean in practice.  
- **Trees and Forests: Overfitting vs. Generalization** – Built Decision Trees and Random Forests, confronting overfitting and reviewing which features truly mattered.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text Classification** – Transitioned from numeric data to text, performing cleaning, vectorization, and building a reliable text classifier.  
- **TensorFlow Deep Learning: My First Neural Network** – Designed, built, and trained a foundational neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. Challenging but incredibly rewarding.
